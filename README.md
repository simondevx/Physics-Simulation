# Physics-Simulation

This is a 2D physics simulation currently consisting of two main parts: a sand dropper and 2D ball collisions. The sand dropper tries to emulate falling sand particles that interact and pile up realistically. The ball collision system simulates circles bouncing off each other and the walls, including basic collision response and movement.
